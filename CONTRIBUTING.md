# Contribution Guidelines

### Coding Guidelines

- Match the style used in the code already

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that maintainability and readability are preserved

- Try to avoid commiting commented out code

- Minimize warnings (and no errors) from the compiler

- Comment subtleties and design decisions

### Commits and PRs

- Try to keep pull requests focused (multiple pull requests are okay). Typically PRs should focus on a single issue or a small collection of closely related issue.

- #### Sign Your Work
    We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

    Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

    To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

        $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."

    This will append the following to your commit message:

        Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>

    By doing this you certify the below:
